# VR Classroom â€” Graduation Project

## Overview
In my graduation project, I started a new challenge that pushed me to learn something I had never thought of learning before game development and the use of the Unity Engine despite having over six years of experience in programming.

At my university, students are required to create a graduation project every year. The idea for this project was proposed by Eng. Ahmed Sultan, who suggested developing a new concept that makes learning easier and more advanced in light of modern technological developments.

## Project Idea
The idea originated from a real problem the university is located far away, and many students live away from home.  
Thatâ€™s where the concept was born: to create a simulation of education using Virtual Reality (VR).

Our goal was to build a complete educational environment through VR.
